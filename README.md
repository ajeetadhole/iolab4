<h1>Music Map</h1>

<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>Music is not visual after all. But when there are millions of songs, it is useful to have some tools to help with this process of discovery. Recommendation and playlists, through visualisation. Visualisations can “tell a story, and engage our pattern-matching brain” (Donaldson & Lamere, ISMIR 2009).
</p>

<p>With the abundance of available music, discovering music is a difficult task. For this purpose, we need tools that can help us explore the world of music and enhance the experience of discovering resources. Enter the brand new shiny application - Music Map that promises to enhance your experience of discovering the world of music. Music Map will help you give the big picture in the jigsaw puzzle of music trends worldwide.</p>

<p>We believe that Music Map will revolutionize the music discovery for users and music analysis for publishers. For users, it provides a new visualization, that provides top trending charts across the world. So music connossiers can enjoy music from across the world without having to deal with various billboards across the world. Music publishers, event organizers can use this data to visualize top ranking charts, genres, across the world in order to reach better channels.</p>

<p>For this application, we investigated the influence of common attributes in terms of 
assortativity coefficients. We then examined larger-scale groupings 
by detecting communities around the type of music that is trending. Our calculations illustrate 
how microscopic and macroscopic perspectives give complementary insights on the music genres that people listen to in a given geographical location.
</p>

<p>Our application is targeted to users (mostly music lovers and music trend analysts) who are interested to know what people in popular metros are listening to.</p>
<h3>Information Organization Challenges for Music Map</h3>

<p>For Music Map, we use various APIs from different partners so making these resources talk to each other without causing major interoperability issue was big challenge. Also, the resource descriptions across various music APIs was non-uniform. We also had to deal with classifying the interactions in order to visualize the music data across different geographical regions. For this classification, we explored various linked data sets and resource description frameworks to adopt the metadata from these sets.</p>
